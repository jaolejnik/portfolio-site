The robot should be able to drive through a whole course from the start to the end without losing track of the designated path and to stop in a case of possible collision. It has been achieved by building a physical robot, creating a computer simulation and implementing an artificial intelligence algorithm using reinforcement learning methods i.e. Deep Q-learning. The ability of the trained network model to make decisions on performing an optimal action for the current state provided by line sensors was tested and described for both the simulation and a real life environment.",

Most of the emergency exit signs are static and cannot be changed during those emergencies. We wanted to address that by designing our handrail to be able to easily adapt and change depending on the situation on the escape route, eg. if an adjacent corridor is on fire, we want to direct passengers to a different, safer route.",
